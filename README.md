# G-UI-191's source code
I was bored so I did this

# Why did you do it?
because it was a shitpost full of good and garbage code that maybe some people need for discord bot

# Can I help fixing it?
Sure, but I won't provide the discord bot to emulate it lmao

# Why isn't it working when I try to emulate it?
I removed every token (the top.gg and discord bot in index.js, then the twitter ones in tweet.js and replytotweet.js)

# How can I emulate it?
Simple: "cd the/bots/folder/or/something/idk", "npm i --save", "node index.js" or "pm2 start index.js" or any way to start a node.js script
If you plan to use it or any of the scripts, make sure to credit me.
